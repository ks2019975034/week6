lntroduction

This pocket reference is a companion to Learning the vi and Vim Editors, by Arnold Robbins et al. lt describes the vi com-mand-line options, command-mode commands, ex com-mands and options, regular expressions and the use of the substitute (s) command, and other pertinent information for using vi.

While retaining coverage of the vi clines, nvi, elvis, and vile, this edition offers expanded coverage of the Vim editor, which has become the de facto standard version of vi in the GNU/Linux world.

The Solaris version of vi served as the "reference" version of the original vi for this pocket reference
